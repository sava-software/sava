# Mutation-testing baseline & triage policy

Each `pitest<Suite>` run is finalized by `pitest<Suite>Verify`, which diffs the
run's unkilled mutants (`SURVIVED` and `NO_COVERAGE`) against the accepted
baseline in `<suite>-accepted.csv` and **fails on anything new**. Baseline row
format: `class,method,line,mutator,status`. Full policy — the three legal
outcomes for a new survivor, determinism requirements, targeting rules —
lives in sava-build's `HARDENING.md`.

Never refresh with `-PupdateMutationBaseline` just to make the build pass:
kill the mutant, refactor it out of existence, or record its equivalence
reason below. Line numbers are part of the baseline key, so edits to a
mutated file shift entries — confirm the verify task's paired stale/"new"
rows are the shifted old ones before refreshing.

## Triaged equivalent mutants (accepted with reasons)

None yet — the `responses` baseline's initial 8 entries are untriaged debt,
not accepted equivalents.

Shrinking the baseline is always an improvement; growing it requires a
reason here.
